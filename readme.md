# GANs Image Generation Project

This project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits and anime-style faces.

## Project Overview

The aim is to create two types of synthetic images:
- **Handwritten Digits**: Generated using the MNIST dataset as a reference.
- **Anime Faces**: Generated using a custom or publicly available anime face dataset.

### GAN Architecture

The project utilizes a classic GAN architecture, comprising two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Takes random noise as input and generates fake images.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates the generated images against real images, distinguishing between authentic and synthetic content.

These networks are trained adversarially: 
- The generator improves by learning to create more convincing fake images.
- The discriminator becomes better at identifying whether an image is real or generated.

### Datasets

- **MNIST Dataset**: Used for generating synthetic handwritten digits.
- **Anime Face Dataset**: Used for generating synthetic anime-style faces.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

2. **Download Datasets**
   - MNIST: The dataset is available via `torchvision.datasets.MNIST`.
   - Anime Faces: Download from a public source or use a custom dataset.

3. **Train the GAN**
   - Train the GAN on the MNIST dataset for digits.
   - Train a separate GAN on the anime face dataset.

4. **Generate Images**
   After training, use the generator to produce new images:
   ```python
   noise = torch.randn(batch_size, noise_dim)
   fake_images = generator(noise)
   ```

5. **Evaluate Results**
   - Compare generated images with real ones to assess the quality.
   - Fine-tune the networks if necessary to improve image realism.

## Project Structure

- `gan_digit.py`: Script for training GAN on the MNIST dataset.
- `gan_anime.py`: Script for training GAN on the anime face dataset.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for image processing and data loading.
- `models.py`: Defines the Generator and Discriminator classes.

## Results

- **Fake Digits**: Synthetic digits that closely resemble those in the MNIST dataset.
- **Anime Faces**: High-quality anime faces generated by the trained GAN.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different GAN architectures like DCGAN or WGAN.
- Explore image quality metrics to quantitatively evaluate the generated images.
- Expand the project to include more complex datasets or combine it with other generative models.
